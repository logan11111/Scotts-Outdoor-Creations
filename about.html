                <p class="introText">Hi, my name is Scott Hepfner and I have been married to my wonderful wife, Angela for 28 years. We have 2 adult kids, and a dog. I was born and raised in Medicine Hat and have called Red Deer home ever since 2012, after taking on a work opportunity and we  have loved it ever since! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have always enjoyed working with my hands and love to create and build unique and creative projects for the enjoyment of others. I pride myself on making quality outdoor pieces and am committed to providing the best product that I can. I believe in excellent customer service and satisfaction as well as ensuring that no matter what I make for you, it will meet your individual needs. I don't have a large workshop and make all outdoor creations in my garage. I am also a believer in open and honest communication. If you have any concerns or questions, I am always available, especially after you take one of my creations home! 
                    Thank you for taking the time to read this and feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. My goal is to make you happy and have years of enjoyment with whatever you decide to purchase!

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks again,
                    <br>
